## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep sky blue (#43A1F0) to evoke a sense of trust, security, and connection to the Solana blockchain, diverging from typical financial app cliches.
- Background color: Light blue (#EBF4FA), a very pale tint of the primary, provides a clean and calming backdrop.
- Accent color: Cyan (#43F0E1), to highlight interactive elements and calls to action, creating a vibrant contrast against the primary color and background.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) combines modernity with approachability.
- Use minimalist icons for navigation and features. Consider line icons with rounded corners to enhance the friendly feel of the app.
- Employ a card-based layout for listings and services to provide a visually organized and easily digestible interface.
- Subtle transitions and animations for loading states and interactions to enhance the user experience and provide visual feedback.
